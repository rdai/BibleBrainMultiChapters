# BibleBrainMultiChapters
Returns bible verse texts across chapter boundaries. e.g. John 1:51-2:3

As of now the BibleBrain API does not support pulling verses from multiple chapters, e.g.John 1:51-2:3. The API builds on top of BibleBrain API and returns back verse texts.
Just provide your API key and the version of the bible you are pulling from.
